Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: When I work with more people, or when I work on different computers. But it is also useful as a backup.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Because the work of other contributer could interfere with the code i am currently working on.
